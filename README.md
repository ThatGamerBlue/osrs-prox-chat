# OSRS Prox Chat
Proximity chat plugin for RuneLite.  

The default server should work for most users. If you want to set up your own server see the [README in the server folder](https://github.com/ThatGamerBlue/osrs-prox-chat/blob/master/server/README.md) on the GitHub issues page.  
You can change the room you're in on the default server for a slightly more protected conversation between you and friends, but if this name gets leaked anybody can join the room.
