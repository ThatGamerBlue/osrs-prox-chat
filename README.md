# OSRS Prox Chat
Proximity chat plugin for RuneLite.  

The default server should work for most users. If you want to set up your own server see issue #1 on the GitHub issues page.
You can change the room you're in for a slightly more protected conversation between you and friends, but if this name gets leaked anybody can join the room.
